## My Movie List

#### What is this?
<p>The main reason this was created is for a user to be able to view 
a list of movies, search through a large database of movies, see details
 about that movie, and save movies to a “watch list” for the user to be able
  to keep track of all the movies they want to see. </p>

#### What technologies were used?
<p>We used, JavaScript, Node.js, Css, Ejs, Mongoose, and a Movie API (see below).
<br>
   This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

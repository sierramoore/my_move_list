## My Movie List

#### What is this?
<p>This was created so a user can store and manage a list of all of the movies they want to be able to see. </p>

<p>
	After creating an account a user is able to:
	• Set their favorite genres, actors, actresses, directors, producers, in preferences
	• A user is shown a random selection of popular movies, their favorite genres, and their favorite actors in the browse page
	• A user can search for movies off of a variety of criteria (title keywords, genre, minimum rating, person keywords)
	• Users can click on specific titles to view more information about the movie
	• Users can add movies to their watch list to keep track of their favorites
	• Users can manage their watchlist be removing movies they have seen.

</p>

#### What technologies were used?
<p>We used, JavaScript, Node.js, Css, EJS, Mongoose, Express.js, MongoDB, and a movie database API (see below).
